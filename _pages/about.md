I am in the final year of my PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Ola Svensson](https://theory.epfl.ch/osven/). My research focuses on foundational problems in theoretical computer science, as well as the mathematical foundations and applications of machine learning.
Before that I earned my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I designed optimization algorithms for pediatric cranial reconstruction surgery. I also worked the [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/), where I developed deep neural networks to simulate quantum systems.
